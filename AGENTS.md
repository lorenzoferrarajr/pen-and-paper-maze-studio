# Maze Generator Notes

This repository is intentionally simple and release-friendly.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` is the entire web app, including markup, styles, client-side JavaScript, PNG rendering, and page-size-aware layout logic.
- `generate-maze-pdf.mjs` is an optional Node.js script for generating printable PDF mazes from the command line.

## Development Guidelines

- Keep the web app self-contained so it can be deployed directly to GitHub Pages.
- Prefer plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript unless there is a strong reason to add tooling.
- Preserve deterministic maze generation when a seed is provided.
- Keep print output clean and usable on standard paper sizes.
- When page size is selected, rows and columns should be derived from the printable area rather than entered manually.
- Difficulty settings should change the generated maze structure in a meaningful way, not just relabel the same output.

## Release Expectations

- No build step should be required for the browser app.
- Public documentation should avoid local machine paths, private tooling references, and internal workflow notes.

# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands

When running shell commands, **always prefix with `rtk`**. This reduces context
usage by 60-90% with zero behavior change. If rtk has no filter for a command,
it passes through unchanged — so it is always safe to use.

## Key Commands
```bash
# Git (59-80% savings)
rtk git status          rtk git diff            rtk git log

# Files & Search (60-75% savings)
rtk ls <path>           rtk read <file>         rtk grep <pattern>
rtk find <pattern>      rtk diff <file>

# Test (90-99% savings) — shows failures only
rtk pytest tests/       rtk cargo test          rtk test <cmd>

# Build & Lint (80-90% savings) — shows errors only
rtk tsc                 rtk lint                rtk cargo build
rtk prettier --check    rtk mypy                rtk ruff check

# Analysis (70-90% savings)
rtk err <cmd>           rtk log <file>          rtk json <file>
rtk summary <cmd>       rtk deps                rtk env

# GitHub (26-87% savings)
rtk gh pr view <n>      rtk gh run list         rtk gh issue list

# Infrastructure (85% savings)
rtk docker ps           rtk kubectl get         rtk docker logs <c>

# Package managers (70-90% savings)
rtk pip list            rtk pnpm install        rtk npm run <script>
```

## Rules
- In command chains, prefix each segment: `rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg"`
- For debugging, use raw command without rtk prefix
- `rtk proxy <cmd>` runs command without filtering but tracks usage

## Memory

Use the `headroom_memory` MCP server for persistent cross-session knowledge.

**Before** answering questions about prior decisions, conventions, project context,
architecture, user preferences, org info, codenames, debugging history, or anything
from past sessions — call `memory_search` first.

**After** making durable decisions, discovering conventions, or learning important
facts — call `memory_save` to persist them for future sessions.

Memory is your first source of truth for anything not visible in the current conversation.
